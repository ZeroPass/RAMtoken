### Ricardian Contract

At no time shall elected block producers freeze or modify this contracts if operating as intended. 
RAMtoken dapp developers are not liable for damages caused by bugs in the code. All Parties are responsible for auditing the code and the Ricardian contract before use. 

### Definition
RAMtoken is an Open-source smart contract that buys the ram from system contract and then issues fully backed RAM token.   
1B of ram = 1 RAM token.   
Ram token allows wallet and exchanges to fully leverage their existing token infrastructure.   

### Intent of the Code  
Intent of the code in this contract is to never allow *ramtokendapp* contract to issue or contain more RAM tokens than the amount of ram it possesses.  
If bug allowing this happens the arbitration forum or block-producers should restore the peg within their ability.  
If the peg is impossible to restore due to the inability to recover funds, the socialised losses would be applied to all accounts (same %) and all of the contract future fees would be used exclusively to make all of the user accounts whole again.

### Contract Maintenance 
The contract might be updated with bug fixes or new features. Transfers might be frozen when fixing the bugs, trying to restore the peg, or during maintenance updates.  
In no way would contract owner account be used to access or modify user balances, that were not a resoult of contract bug/unexpected behaviour.  
If that still happens, the arbitration forum or block-producers should restore the contract previous balances within their ability.
